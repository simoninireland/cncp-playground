    "Do *all* diseases lead to epidemics? Intuitively it seems quite unlikely: a really uninfectious disease (one with a small value of $\\beta$), or a disease that didn't stay infectious for very long (one with a large value of $\\alpha$) -- or both -- would seem to be candidates for diseases that don't become epidemic. In the first case, the disease is hard to pass from infected to susceptible individuals; in the latter, it has only a small time window in which to do so before the host individual is removed. One might also expect that a really sparse network would fail to transmit the disease well, since an infectd node would have few neighbours to infect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, for some networks at least, there's a well-defined value of infectiousness that, when exceeded, causes epidemic outbreaks. This is referred to as the **epidemic threshold** (also sometimes called the **percolation threshold** for reasons that'll become clear when we discuss percolation theory)."

    "Let's see how the epidemic threshold manifests itself. To do this we'll run an epidemic disease process over a random ER network, keeping the removal (recovery) rate constant and varying the infection rate. We expect that the size of epidemic will shift dramatically, rather than steadily, as the infection rate increases. This **phase transition** -- from small numbers of infected individuals to essentially everyone being infected -- occurs when $\\beta$ cross the epidemic threshold, which we'll denote $\\beta_{crit}$.\n",
