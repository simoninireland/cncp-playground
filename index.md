Welcome to the Complex Networks, Complex Processes Playground
=============================================================

CNCP Playground is an interactive learning resource intended for people wanting to understand
nework science. It combines theory and practice in an innovative way: all the mathematical
theory is backed with code, while all the code has its underlying theorty explained. The
idea is to let aspiring network scientists climb the twin learning curves needed to
understand stochastic processes on networks *and* discrete-event simulation using modern
software techniques.
